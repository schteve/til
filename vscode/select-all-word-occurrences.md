# Select all word occurrences

Often you will want to modify the same word in various parts of a document. You *could* use search and replace, but it might be quicker to just select all occurrences of the word and directly edit them. You can do this by highlighting the word you want to edit and using the shortcut (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`L`).

Note this doesn't seem to be strictly limited to words, you can use it on any string. VS Code calls this "Select all occurrences of current selection". There is also "Select all occurrences of current word" which doesn't require a selection (just put the cursor in the word) which can be used with `Ctrl`+`F2`.
